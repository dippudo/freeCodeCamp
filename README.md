# Programs from freeCodeCamp courses
A repository for all my personal code and notes made from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) courses.

This repository contains programs mainly coded in Python.

Many freeCodeCamp videos, tutorials, and courses are not in Python. However, I am currently working on increasing my experience in Python so I therefore take the key concepts and logic to solve the same problems but in Python.

I take my notes using the ["excalidraw" extension in visual studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and they have a .excalidraw file extension. I find that taking notes with diagrams makes it much easier to internalise and digest the concepts, feel free to do the same for yourself when learning :)
