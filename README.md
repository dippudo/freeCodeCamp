# freeCodeCamp
A repository for all my personal code and notes made from freeCodeCamp courses.

This repository contains programs mainly coded in Python.

Many freeCodeCamp videos, tutorials, and courses are not in Python. However, I am currently working on increasing my experience in Python so I therefore take the key concepts and logic to solve the same problems in Python.
