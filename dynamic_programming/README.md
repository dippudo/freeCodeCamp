# Dynamic Programming

This folder contains all my code and notes made from freeCodeCamp's "[Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)" video on YouTube.

*my notes were taken through an ["excalidraw" extension in visual studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and have a .excalidraw file extension.*
